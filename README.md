# to whom it may concern
In this project I was in intent to create a simple crud application and to train a little bit of each  knowledge that I have. 

Example: I could put a Custom swing  on all Jframe,or put  more  field to employee, but  I wanted  only to apply a bit of each knowledge that I have, as I’m beginner  maybe you can find any bugs, so be patient if you find them or find unnecessary things, but during testing I tried to consider all the issues and prevent them.

I applied some PATTERNS like SINGLETON AND STRATEGY, but yes , I know in a implementation that I made, I know that I could made it in other way, but I wanted  to train them.

The code is heavily commented , each functionally each statement are comment so that it can be really understable.

 Please comment or give me a email about what could do to make it better.

I've made a video about the application running. So that  you guys can see how application look like before you take it
